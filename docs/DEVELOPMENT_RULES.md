---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-Compliance Consequences

### Rule Violations:
- Code reviews will be rejected
- Deployment blocked until compliance
- Required documentation updates before merge
- Team discussion for repeated violations

### Emergency Exceptions:
- Critical bug fixes may bypass some rules
- Must be documented and reviewed post-deployment
- Retrospective to prevent future issues
- Documentation debt must be addressed
