## üìã Step-by-Step Workflow Design

### **Step 1: Job Description Processing**
**Node Type**: Webhook Trigger
**Purpose**: Receive job description text from Lovable frontend

```json
{
  "webhook_config": {
    "method": "POST",
    "authentication": "header_auth",
    "response_mode": "lastNode"
  },
  "input_data": {
    "job_description": "string",

Return only the primary company name in this format:
{
  "company_name": "exact company name",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "variations": ["alt name 1", "alt name 2"],
  "industry_hint": "tech/finance/healthcare/etc"

## ‚ö° **Performance Optimizations**

### **Parallel Processing**:
- 6 research streams run simultaneously
- 30-60 second total processing time
- Fail-safe fallbacks for each stream

### **Caching Strategy**:
```json
{
  "company_cache": {
    "duration": "24_hours",
    "key": "company_name",
    "includes": ["overview", "culture", "recent_news"]

    "key": "industry_sector",
    "includes": ["trends", "skills", "benchmarks"]
  }
}
```

### **Error Handling**:
- Graceful degradation if research streams fail
- Minimum viable output even with partial data
- User notification of any research limitations
