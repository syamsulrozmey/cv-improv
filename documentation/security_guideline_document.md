# Security Guidelines for CV-Improv

The following document defines the security principles and controls to be embedded throughout the design, development, and operations of the CV-Improv application. It follows industry best practices to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data.

---

## 1. Authentication & Access Control

• **Strong Password Policies**
  - Enforce minimum length (≥ 12 characters), complexity (upper, lower, digit, symbol), and disallow common passwords.  
  - Use bcrypt (cost factor ≥ 12) or Argon2id with unique salts for password hashing.

• **Session Management**
  - Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookies for session tokens.  
  - Implement idle (15–30 min) and absolute (24 hr) timeouts; provide explicit logout to revoke sessions server-side.

• **JWT Best Practices** (if applicable)
  - Reject tokens with `alg: none`; enforce signature validation with RS256 or HS256.  
  - Validate `exp` and `iat` claims; rotate keys periodically and maintain a key-id (kid) header.

• **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Define roles (`admin`, `user`, `viewer`) and map to minimal permissions.  
  - Enforce authorization checks on every API endpoint; never rely on client-side role gating.

• **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - Offer optional TOTP-based MFA for sensitive operations (e.g., sharing export links).

## 2. Input Handling & Data Processing

• **Input Validation**
  - Validate all fields on server with strict schemas (e.g., Joi, Zod).  
  - Enforce length, type, format (emails, dates), and value ranges.

• **Prevent Injection Attacks**
  - Use parameterized queries/ORM (TypeORM, Prisma) for database operations.  
  - Sanitize user‐supplied Markdown or rich text before rendering; apply a whitelist of allowed tags/attributes.

• **File Upload Security**
  - Restrict to PDF and DOCX; verify MIME type and file signature.  
  - Set size limit (e.g., ≤ 5 MB) and scan uploads for malware.  
  - Store uploads outside webroot (e.g., AWS S3 with private ACLs); never execute or serve directly.

• **Output Encoding**
  - Apply context-aware encoding (HTML, URL, JSON) to all user content displayed in the WYSIWYG editor or export preview.

---

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy

• **Encryption in Transit**
  - Enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) on all endpoints.  
  - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS; use HSTS with `max-age` ≥ 6 months and `includeSubDomains`.

• **Encryption at Rest**
  - Enable database encryption (PostgreSQL TDE or at-rest encryption on hosted DB).  
  - Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., email) with application-level AES-256 before persisting.

• **Secrets Management**
  - Store API keys, database credentials, and OpenAI tokens in a secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  
  - Do not commit secrets or `.env` files to source control.

• **Data Minimization & Privacy**
  - Collect only necessary PII; purge stale data (e.g., inactive accounts after 1 year).  
  - Provide users a mechanism to delete all personal data in compliance with GDPR/CCPA.

---

## 4. API & Service Security

• **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
  - Implement per-user and global rate limits on critical endpoints (e.g., AI suggestions, file import).  
  - Use a library like `express-rate-limit` backed by Redis.

• **CORS**
  - Allow only trusted origins (e.g., `https://cv-improv.com`).  
  - Restrict methods, headers, and disallow credentials for cross-origin if not required.

• **API Versioning**
  - Prefix endpoints with `/api/v1/`; maintain backward compatibility and deprecate old versions.

• **Least Privilege for Services**
  - Configure database users with only required privileges (e.g., no `SUPERUSER`).  
  - Segment microservices or functions so that an exploited service cannot access all data.

---

## 5. Web Application Security Hygiene

• **Security HTTP Headers**
  - Content-Security-Policy: restrict sources to self for scripts, styles, fonts, and images.  
  - X-Content-Type-Options: `nosniff`; X-Frame-Options: `DENY`; Referrer-Policy: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.

• **CSRF Protection**
  - For state-changing requests (POST/PUT/DELETE), implement synchronizer tokens or use double-submit cookies.

• **Cookie Hardening**
  - Set `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` for all session and JWT cookies.

• **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**
  - Apply SRI hashes when loading third-party scripts or stylesheets from CDNs.

---

## 6. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

• **Server Hardening**
  - Disable unused services and ports; apply OS security patches promptly.  
  - Enforce file system permissions: app runs under unprivileged user; configuration files restricted.

• **Secure CI/CD**
  - Store CI secrets in encrypted vault; restrict pipeline triggers to protected branches.  
  - Fail builds on vulnerability scans (Snyk, npm audit, pip-audit) and lint/security rule violations.

• **TLS Configuration**
  - Use strong cipher suites (ECDHE-RSA with AES-GCM).  
  - Disable SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1.  
  - Regularly renew certificates via automated tooling (Let’s Encrypt).

---

## 7. Dependency Management

• **Secure Dependencies**
  - Maintain `package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock`; review pull-request diffs on lockfiles.  
  - Use Dependabot or Renovate to surface and apply security updates promptly.

• **Vulnerability Scanning**
  - Integrate SCA tools into CI (e.g., GitHub Advanced Security, Sonatype OSS Index).  
  - Address high/critical CVEs before merging.

• **Minimize Footprint**
  - Only include essential libraries; remove unused or experimental dependencies.

---

## 8. DevOps & CI/CD Security

• **Immutable Infrastructure**
  - Use container images or managed services (e.g., Vercel, Heroku) with versioned builds.  
  - Rebuild environments from source on each deploy; avoid snowflakes.

• **Continuous Monitoring**
  - Implement application logs (structured JSON), aggregated centrally (e.g., ELK).  
  - Configure alerts on anomalous behavior (e.g., spike in failed logins, error rates).

• **Backup & Recovery**
  - Automate daily backups of database and object storage; test restores quarterly.

## Conclusion

By embedding these controls into the architecture and development workflows of CV-Improv, we create robust defense-in-depth coverage. Regularly revisit and update these guidelines to address emerging threats and evolving best practices.
